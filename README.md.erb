**kak-spec** is a unit test framework for
[Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) scripts and plugins.
The framework is designed to help plugin developers, but it can also be useful for studying the
behavior of the kakoune scripting language.
Using **kak-spec** is a matter of
- installing it,
- writing unit tests in kakoune script, and
- running the tests using an executable called **kak-spec**.

## Example

Example of running `kak-spec example/hello-world.kak-spec`:

More examples can be found
- in the [example](https://github.com/jbomanson/kak-spec.kak/tree/main/example) directory, which contains both passing and intentionally failing tests, and
- in the [spec](https://github.com/jbomanson/kak-spec.kak/tree/main/spec) directory, which contains tests intended to pass.

## Dependencies

- ruby

- [prelude.kak](https://github.com/alexherbo2/prelude.kak)

## Installation of kak-spec and the prelude.kak dependency

The following steps install a `kak-spec` executable under
`/path/to/prefix/directory/bin`, and man pages under
`/path/to/prefix/directory/share/man/man1`.
A typical choice for `/path/to/prefix/directory` would be `~/.local`.

### Alternative #1: With plug.kak

You can install **kak-spec** using the
[plug.kak](https://github.com/robertmeta/plug.kak) plugin manager by extending
your `kakrc` with:

```kak
plug "alexherbo2/prelude.kak"
plug "jbomanson/kak-spec.kak" do %(
    make install PREFIX=/path/to/prefix/directory
)
```

Then start Kakoune and run `:plug-install`.

### Alternative #2: Manually

```sh
cd /path/to/plugins/directory
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/alexherbo2/prelude.kak
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/jbomanson/kak-spec.kak
cd kak-spec && make install PREFIX=/path/to/prefix/directory
# OPTIONAL: Place a soft link of the rc directory in your %val(config)/autoload directory.
```

After the installation is done, the cloned directories should stay where they are.
This is important, because the installation process makes soft links to content inside the
`kak-spec` directory and `kak-spec` expects to find `prelude.kak` from a location next to it.

## Usage

### Defining Tests in Kakoune Script

<%=
  # Extract and format the docstring of the kak-spec command.
  File.read("rc/kak-spec.asciidoc")[/^== Commands.*^== Options.*?(?===|\Z)/m].
    gsub(/^== /, "#### ").
    gsub(/^ {4}/, '').
    gsub(/^ *(\*.*):::$/, "- \\1\n").
    gsub('*', '**').
    gsub(/::/, ':').
    gsub(/<(\w+)>/, '_\1_')
-%>

### Running Tests from the Command Line Usage

<%=
  quoted = []
  # Extract and format the help text from the executable.
  File.read("lib/runner.sh")[/cat <<EOF\K.*?^(?=EOF)/m].
    each_line.grep_v(/See.*github.com/).join.
    gsub(/"([^"]*)"/) {quoted << "`#{$~[1]}`"; "€QUOTED€"}.
    gsub(/^(?=-\w)/, '- ').
    gsub(/<(\w+)>/, '_\1_').
    gsub(/(?<!\w)-([\w%()\[\]{}<>-]+)|(?<![\/])kak-spec/, '**\0**').
    gsub("€QUOTED€") {quoted.shift}
-%>

## PROTIP: Rerunning tests as they change

**kak-spec** works well with file watcher programs such as
[entr](http://eradman.com/entrproject/) that rerun arbitrary commands as some files change.
For example, in a git project with test files in a directory hierarchy under `kak-spec`, one could
run:
```sh
while true; do
  git ls-files | entr -cd kak-spec
done
```
These commands would rerun kak-spec on *.kak-spec files under `kak-spec` whenever any file currently
tracked by git changes.
